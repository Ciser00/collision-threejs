A test of three js for:

    -moving objects 
    -object intercations 
        -with each other 
        -with certain points on the screen 
    -interaction 

Two balls and one cube move 
The big ball simply moves left to right on the x axis and will repell the other shapes when they make contact 

The cube will bounce arond and hit the walls on its own 

The ball can be interacted with by pressing the "-" or "=" (+) keys to speed up or slow down the small black ball
